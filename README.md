# MitySG - CS3216 Assignment 3

‘MitySG: Am I There Yet?’ is a localised public transport notification web app that allows commuters to be glued to their screens and yet be aware about their transit arrival. Doing away with simply listing bus arrival timings, ‘MitySG’ pushes notifications the user when their user’s bus is arriving and when they are arriving at their destination (both Bus and MRT).
